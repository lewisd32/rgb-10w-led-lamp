Source code for a 120 watt RGB LED lamp, with peripheral modules.
I've written a bit about the project here: http://www.surprisingedge.com/100-watt-rgb-led-lamp/

Some of the code in this repository uses Adafruit NeoPixel rings as a simpler, low-power way of demoing some of the intended functionality of the lamp.

Required Libraries:
 - hsl2rgb - https://github.com/lewisd32/avr-hsl2rgb
 - Adafruit\_NeoPixel - https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit\_NeoPixel
 - Adafruit\_TLC59711 - https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit\_TLC59711


Thanks:
I would not have been able to get the peripheral interface working, were it not for these excellent resources:
